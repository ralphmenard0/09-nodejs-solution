09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator
License: MIT

Description
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

Motivation
Streamlining each step of the programming process enables the developer to spend more time problem-solving and less time duplicating efforts. Automating the process of creating README.md files is one step in streamlining project development.

Learning Targets
This exercise provided my first experience with Node.js, NPM packages, and generating a new file as ouput.

Core Objectives Met
Following the completion of prompts about an application's repository, the user is presented with a high-quality, professional README.md, generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
When a user enters the project title, it is displayed as the title of the README.
When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
When a user chooses a license for the application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
When a user enters their GitHub username, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile.
When a user enters their email address, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
